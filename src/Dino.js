         <h1>Dinosaurs and the origin of birds</h1>
        <p>
         Based on fossil and biological evidence, most scientists accept that birds
    are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs and, more specifically,
    members of Maniraptora, a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurids
    and oviraptorosaurs, among others. As scientists have discovered more
    theropods closely related to birds, the previously clear distinction between
    non-birds and birds has become blurred. Recent discoveries in the Liaoning
    Province of northeast China, which demonstrate many small theropod feathered
    dinosaurs, contribute to this ambiguity.

    The consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying
    theropods, or avialans, are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs,
    which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids. Together, these form a group
    called Paraves. Some basal members of Deinonychosauria, such as Microraptor,
    have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal
    deinonychosaurs were very small. This evidence raises the possibility that
    the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal, have been able to
    glide, or both. Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered
    dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, recent studies suggest that the first
    avialans were omnivores.

  <h1>Picodynastornithes</h1>
  <p>
    Picodynastornithes is a clade that contains the orders Coraciiformes
    (rollers and kingfishers) and Piciformes (woodpeckers and toucans). This
    grouping also has current and historical support from molecular and
    morphological studies.

    This order has been seen to be something of a mixed assortment, and the
    Coraciiformes may be considered as including only the rollers. All the other
    families would then be considered to represent lineages of birds distantly
    related to Coraciiformes. This seems to be oversplitting, as most
    Coraciiformes indeed form a reasonably robust clade. Analysis of nDNA c-myc
    and RAG-1 exon as well as mtDNA myoglobin intron 2 sequence data
    demonstrates that the Coraciiformes can be divided into a basal group that
    is not too distantly related to the Piciformes, and a derived suborder
    containing mainly kingfishers (Johansson & Ericson, 2003). The cuckoo
    roller's true affinities appear to lie elsewhere. The trogons and hornbills
    are either very basal lineages, or might be considered distinct own orders;
    the latter are apparently slightly closer to the rollers than the former.
    The entire group (possibly excluding the cuckoo roller) and the Piciformes
    are closely related to the Passeriformes (Johansson & Ericson 2003; see also
    near passerine).

    The European green woodpecker (Picus viridis) is a large green woodpecker
    with a bright red crown and a black moustache. Males have a red centre to
    the moustache stripe which is absent in females. It is resident across much
    of Europe and the western Palearctic but in Spain and Portugal it is
    replaced by the similar Iberian green woodpecker (Picus sharpei). The
    European green woodpecker spends much of its time feeding on ants on the
    ground and does not often 'drum' on trees like other woodpecker species.
    Though its vivid green and red plumage is particularly striking, it is a shy
    bird, and is more often heard than seen, drawing attention with its loud
    calls. A nest hole is excavated in a tree; four to six eggs are laid which
    hatch after 19 to 20 days.

    The cuckoo-roller or courol (Leptosomus discolor) is the only bird in the
    family Leptosomidae /lɛptoʊˈsɒmɪdiː/, which was previously often placed in
    the order Coraciiformes but is now placed in its own order Leptosomiformes.
    The cuckoo-roller is at the root of a group that contains the Trogoniformes,
    Bucerotiformes, Piciformes, and Coraciiformes. Despite its name, the
    Cuckoo-roller does not share close evolutionary origins with cuckoos or
    rollers at all.

  <h3>Rickrolling internet phenomenon</h3>
  <p>
    In 2007, Astley became the subject of a viral Internet meme known as
    rickrolling. The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised
    hyperlink that leads to the Never Gonna Give you Up music video. When
    victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video
    loads instead of what was expected, and in doing so they are said to have
    been "rickrolled". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in
    unexpected places. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through
    several publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008
    April Fools' Day event. Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the
    early 2020s. In online classes on Zoom during the worldwide COVID-19
    lockdown, students often rickrolled their classmates and teachers. A 4K
    remaster of the "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video went viral in early
    2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    Astley was born on 6 February 1966 in Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire, the
    fourth child of his family. His parents divorced when he was five and Astley
    was brought up by his father Horace Astley. When he was 10 years old, Astley
    began singing in a local church choir, which began his love of music.
  </p>
  <p>
    Richard Paul Astley is an English singer, songwriter and radio personality,
    who has been active in music for several decades. He gained worldwide fame
    in the 1980s, having multiple hits, including his signature song "Never
    Gonna Give You Up", "Together Forever" and "Whenever You Need Somebody". He
    returned to music full-time in the 2000s after a 6-year hiatus. Outside his
    music career, Astley has occasionally worked as a radio DJ and a podcaster.
